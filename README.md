# Hi!
This is the source code for my personal website that I use at www.kitopham.com and www.kpham.co.
I'm continually updating this code as I pick up new things about various things such as architecture choices,
design patterns, or just general features that I want to add!

To do list:
- ~~Responsive home page~~
- Better scaling on homepage images for smaller sizes

- ~~Flexible project page with sections~~
- Firebase / input forms for updating project posts
- Direct email
- Dynamic floating action button with a circle menu
- Responsive About page
- Photography Gallery Page
